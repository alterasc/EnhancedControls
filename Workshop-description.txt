[h2]Adds couple of new keybindings.[/h2] 

You can disable or rebind any part of the mod that you want but by default this conflicts with default control scheme, so read what you're getting into. 


[h3]Separate End Turn button - default: Ctrl+Space[/h3]
If this button is bound, then it moves End Turn/Start Battle functionality from Pause button to new button.
Do NOT use in conjuction with Toybox "Disable end turn HotKey" option. Choose one or another.

[h3]Separate Toggle Highlight Objects - default: Ctrl+R[/h3]
Enables/disables object highlighting.
Do NOT use in conjuction with Toybox "Object Highlight Toggle Mode" option. Choose one or another.

[h3]Next character - default: Tab[/h3]
Works in character menu and inventory and on surface.
Moves selection to the next character.
Conflicts with default "Highlight objects" binding. So unbind or change one of the two.
My suggestion is to assign normal highlight to "R" (because my default for toggle is Ctrl+R)

[h3]Previous character - default: Shift+Tab[/h3]
Works in character menu and inventory and on surface.
Moves selection to the previous character.
Conflicts with default steam overlay. So unbind or change if you're on steam.

[h3]Next tab - default: Ctrl+Tab[/h3]
Works in character menu and inventory.
In character menu moves selection to next page tab  (so Summary -> Features -> Archetypes ->...)
In inventory moves inventory filter (All -> Weapons -> Armor -> ...)

[h3]Inventory Search - default: Ctrl-F[/h3]
When you're in inventory, this activates inventory search field.

[h3]Collect All and Close - default: F[/h3]
In loot window collects all and closes loot window


[h2]Configuration:[/h2]
Through native game settings.
Go to Settings -> Controls -> scroll to the bottom
To disable setting, just unbind the key.
Note - at the moment it does not take into account alternative keybind, only main one.

[b]Changes are appled only after restart.[/b]
