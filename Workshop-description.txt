[h2]Main settings[/h2]
[h3]Separate Toggle Highlight Objects - default: Ctrl+R[/h3]
Enables/disables object highlighting.
Do NOT use in conjuction with Toybox "Object Highlight Toggle Mode" option. Choose one or another.
[h2]Camera[/h2]
[h3]Rotate camera with right mouse button (Experimental) (toggle)- default: Off[/h3]
Rotate camera with right mouse button instead of middle.
Warning: enabling this will make you lose some stuff assigned to RMB. 
You will lose this holdover thing from PF games, where you could press and hold RMB and then mouse to make your party face some direction. Visual pointer that PF games had was removed, while button still kinda works.
Maybe more.
Use at your own risk.
